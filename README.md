# Pre-work - *TIPP*

<!-- **Name of your app** is a tip calculator application for iOS. -->

Submitted by: **Omaru Jawara**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

A challenge I encountered was that when the value in the bill amount text field is changed, the tip and total amount didn't update unless I use the UIslider.
That component is where I spent much time figuring out; eventually I figured it out.
